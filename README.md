Home Cybersecurity Lab: A Virtual Network Simulation Environment

This cybersecurity home lab is a versatile and dynamic environment designed to simulate a virtualized network for practicing and mastering essential cybersecurity skills. Tailored for both beginners and advanced learners, the lab includes preinstalled tools such as kali Linux, Metasploit, and Nmap, all configured to create a secure and user-friendly setup. The lab features multiple interconnected virtual machines (VMs) that emulate real-world network infrastructures, offering a practical platform to explore cybersecurity tasks such as simulating network attacks, implementing defense strategies, and analyzing traffic, Its modular design provides the flexibility to expand the environment by adding additional machines, configuring new services,  and experimenting with a variety of tools and techniques, This project is an ideal foundation for hands-on learning, skill development, exploring the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, and demonstrates my experience in setting up virtualized environments using ISO files for Kali Linux and Ubuntu.

Prerequisites
1.	VirtualBox installed (version 7.0 or higher).
2.	At least 8 GB of RAM.
3.	20 GB of free disk space
4.	Download Kali Linuz OS image at www.kali.org/downloads/
5.	Download Ubuntu OS image at www.ubuntu.com/downloads/desktop

Development Process
Phase 1: Research and Planning
1.	Defining the Purpose:
  •	I recognized the need for a practical, hand-on environment to hone cybersecurity skills. But I realized there are others, like Cyber Dojo, in the industry that realize the same and have put forth a model like the one I am presenting. As a matter of fact, this cyber security simulation model is a direct reflection of the www.cybermentordojo.com security simulation model. In addition, the previous mentioned gave me the purpose, and I am just simply adding to it as I encourage anyone reading this to do as well.  
2.	Choosing the Tools and Platforms:
  •	Selected VirtualBox as the hypervisor for hosting multiple VMs due to its open-source nature and ease of use.
  •	Decided on using Kali Linuz for penetration testing, Ubuntu Server for hosting services, and Windows Server for Active Directory simulation.
  •	Integrated tools like Wireshark for traffic analysis, Suricata for IDS/IPS, and Metasploit for attack simulations.
3.	Setting objectives for the Lab:
  •	Basic network topology: Simulate a small LAN with at least one attacker machine, one serve, and one workstation,
  •	Salability: Ensure the lab can grow by adding VMs and services without major reconfiguration.

Phase 2: Lab Design and Configuration
1.	Network Topology Design:
  •	Created a virtual network with the following components:
    -Router/Firewall: Configured using pfSense for network segmentation.
    -Attack Machine: Kali Linuz for conduction penetration tests.
    -Defensive Systems: Suricata for Intrusion Detection.
    -Target Machines: Windows Serfer for simulating enterprise environments, and Ubuntu for hosting services like web servers and databases.
  •	Configured a NAT network in VirtualBox to provide internet access while isolating virtual environments.
2.	Setting Up Virtual Machines:
  •	Installed operating systems on each VM.
  •	Configured network interfaces to connect machines within the virtualized network.
  •	Installed necessary tools and software \for each role (e,g, Metasploit on Kali, Apache on Ubuntu).
3.	Basic Services and Features:
  •	Set up essential services like DNS, DHCP, and FTP to mimic real-word environments.
  •	Enable logging and monitoring on all machines for analysis.

Phase 3: Implementation
1.	Simulation Network Attacks
  •	Performed common attack simulations such as port scanning, brute force attempts, and exploitation using Metasploit. 
  •	Logged and analyzed malicious traffic using Wireshark,
2.	Implementing Defenses:
  •	Configured Suricata rules to detect specific attack signatures.
  •	Hardened service with firewalls, encryption, and secure configurations.
4.	Traffic Analysis:
  •	Captured and analyzed network traffic to identify anomalies and attack patterns.
  •	Used packet analysis tools like Wireshark to study protocol behavior.

Phase 4: Documentation and Expansion
1.	Documenting the Setup:
  •	Created step-by-step instructions for setting up the lab, including:
    -Installing VirtualBox and creating VMs.
    -Configuring network interfaces and NAT settings.
    -Installing and configuring tools.
  •	Detailed how-to guides for running attack and defense scenarios.
2.	Testing and Refinement:
  •	Performed stress tests by increasing traffic and adding more VMs to ensure scalability.
  •	Documented lessons learned and troubleshooting tips.
3.	Expansion Potential:
  •	Added optional configurations for additional services like Active Directory, MySQL databases, and honeypots.
  •	Designed modular scripts to automate parts of the setup.

Phase 5: Uploading to GitHub
1.	Project Preparation:
  •	Organized files into folders:
    -Scripts: Automation scripts for setup and configuration.
    -Documentation: Setup guides, network topology diagrams, and usage instructions.
    -Configurations: Pre-configured files for tools like Suricata and pfSensse.
    -Demos: Screenshots and videos of the lab in action.
  •	Removed sensitive information (e,g., passwords, private keys).
2.	Creating the Repository: 
  •	Setup a new repository on GitHub with a descriptive name and README.
  •	Added a README.md file explaining; 
    -The project purpose.
    -Setup instructions.
    -How to use the lab.
  •	Uploaded project files and committed them to the repository.

Phase 6: Final Touches:
  •	Added tags for easy discovery (e.g., cybersecurity, virtual-lab, network-securiity).
  •	Included a reference and mention to Cyber Dojo for providing the assistance and inspiration for this project.
